# Garbage Quest

My contribution to the [2022 Seven Day Roguelike challenge](https://itch.io/jam/7drl-challenge-2022). It is a game about cleaning up garbage with your friends.

The client is written in TypeScript, and uses [Roguelike Pumpkin Patch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/roguelike-pumpkin-patch) for the display, RNG, and FOV.

The server is a Node.js server, currently deployed to Heroku.

The game has been released and is playable on [itch.io](https://laurheth.itch.io/garbage-quest). Check it out!

## It's time to take out the trash!

This dungeon, converted into an apartment complex, is full of trash. It's everywhere! Absolutely filthy. There's only one thing to do...

## Put the garbage down the garbage chute!

Together with your friends and/or internet strangers, you must collect the trash, and you must put it all down the garbage chute. Or carry it directly to the garbage room if you're already on the main floor. Let no garbage be left un-discarded!

## An exciting and dynamic multiplayer experience!

Exist in a multi-user apartment complex / dungeon with other people! Take out the trash. Express all known human thoughts and emotions (about garbage) via the highly innovative garbage chat system.
